In regards to testing and unit tests there are edit mode tests and play mode tests. Edit mode tests are tests that run and just look at scripts and testing logic. 
Play mode tests are that actually run a scene or game to test physics, movement, animation, etc.

We can specifically target WebGL in the pipeline and have it automatically build and generate artifacts. 

We can also potentially go one step further and actually deploy the WebGL build to github pages and even play the game after its been built. This may or may not work out since 
I believe Github pages are public unless you have a pro account. We can look into this further.

Here is a completely untested first draft attempt at what the pipeline might look like:

name: Unity CI
